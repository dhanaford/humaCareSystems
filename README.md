# humanCareSystems
A to-do app for Human Care Systems.

This application was built with Vue.Js, Node.Js, Express.Js, and MongoDB. I've hard-coded user information into the front-end for demonstration purposes. Login information can be found below. I did not have time to update the state of the application to recognize sessions. That means, anytime you refresh the application, current state information, including login credentials are lost :(. I'd like to improve this by implementing user creation/authentication into MongoDB.

## Usage
`git clone` repo

run `npm run install` in roor directory

then...

cd into directory, cd into /server and
`npm run dev`

then

type a `..` and cd into /client and
run `npm install` 
and then `npm run dev`

Once the application loads, enter the following username
and password:

Enter username: 'test@gmail.com'
Enter password: 'login123'
